How to add my cool custom map?

 1.) Move or copy your map to Command & Conquer Red Alert II\Maps\Custom\ folder
 
	- (important!) if your map has other file extension (.yrm for example) change it to .map
	- (optional) sometimes map name (inside map file) must be identical as map filename
	- (optional) using FinalAlert2 or Notepad++ to edit map manually is recommended
   
  2.) If your map isn't showing in the lobby then
  
	- Open map using raw text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, etc)
	- Make sure that in section [Basic] there is gamemode defined
		it should look like this:
		
	[Basic]
	GameMode=standard
