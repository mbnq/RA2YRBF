Red Alert 2: Yuri's Revenge: Brute Force Mod

***********************************************************************
	   ** Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge - Brute Force Beta **
Version: 0.8.43
***********************************************************************
**Installation:**

- Download, unzip, copy files into the game directory
- Use *BFLauncher.exe* to start the game

If you are not installing for the first time but updating the Brute Force mod
use bf_uninstaller.bat first then install the new version of the mod.

This mod requires a clean installation of Red Alert 2 and the Yuri's Revenge expansion pack to play.
Ensure your game is updated to version 1.001 before installation.
Works well with the EA and Steam version.

**Updating:**
- run bf_uninstaller.bat in your game directory, enter random safety code and pres enter
- unzip, and copy files into the game directory
- when windows ask for replacing 2 files do not replace - if you want to keep your settings

Note: In the nearest future autoupdater will be included.

***********************************************************************
**Important:**

- Use *BFLauncher.exe* to run the mod
- If nothing happens when you run *BFLauncher.exe* check FAQ point 6 (link to FAQ below)

- Yuri is the main opponent, you should play against him
- Brute Force is still in the beta phase, which means bugs, glitches and crashes will occur
- Each included tool from tools folder comes with its own readme file

***********************************************************************
**Notes:**

- The overall performance depends on your CPU, as the game engine utilizes only one core. 
  Factors that affect FPS in the game includes the map (pathfinding), the number of AI players, and difficulty settings. 
  If you're experiencing performance issues, try using simpler maps (included), fewer AI players, or lower difficulty settings. 
  I'm continually working on optimization tweaks.
  You can also use recently implemented settings in skirmish/mp menu such as:
	- AI Attack Rate
	- AI Mission Rate	
	- AI Stray
	- AI Base Size
	- AI Path Tick Time
